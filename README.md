# RecursiveMazeSolver
Program is a maze solver that uses the DFS approach. The program takes a 2D char array that represents a maze, the program will solve the maze 
recursively and trace a path to exit the maze if there is an exit solution and display the traced maze 
recursively along with prompting the user to guess how many steps it takes to get to exit. If the maze is 
not solvable, the maze won't be displayed.
